# react-material-components

react components for [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)

---
These components bring material components in an a-la-carté fashion.
You can use `n` number of components without taking the weight of any extra code of the components you do not use.

`react-material-components` is a thin opinion-less wrapper over [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages). Use these for painless integration of these components into your project, without taking the bloat.

Smaller bundles FTW!!!
